# VeriVault Pitch Deck - Slide Content

## Slide 1: Title / Hero
**Visual:** 
*   Background: Dark, abstract nodes connecting (network).
*   Foreground: Screenshot of VeriVault Dashboard Hero Section.
*   Text: "VeriVault: Proof of Solvent Execution"

**Speaker Notes:**
"In Crypto, everyone *claims* they're non-custodial. But if you can't verify the math, you're just trusting a database. VeriVault changes that."

## Slide 2: The Action (The Risk Engine)
**Visual:**
*   Split Screen: 
    *   Left: VeriVault "Trade Feed" showing "Processing..." badge.
    *   Right: Operator Terminal Code (Matrix style) or simple icon of "Enclave".

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is our live Risk Engine on Sepolia. When a user trades, we don't just update a SQL database. We spin up a Zero-Knowledge Proof in a secure enclave that mathematically certifies the trade complies with solvency rules."

## Slide 3: The Proof (The Reveal)
**Visual:**
*   Main Image: Screenshot of the **Proof Modal** (Green Checkmark).
*   Overlay/Arrow: Pointing to Etherscan screenshot showing "Input Data" (Hex).
*   Text Highlight: "Zero-Knowledge Verified"

**Speaker Notes:**
"See this checkmark? It's backed by this transaction on Sepolia Etherscan. The smart contract REJECTED any state change until this proof passed the on-chain verifier. 100% Math. 0% Trust."
