# For Phase 2 MVP, we use Anvil (Foundry) as the "Sovereign Chain" to simulate the CDK behavior quickly.
# This avoids the heavy setup of a full Polygon CDK cluster while developing the contracts and logic.
# In a real "Phase 2b", we would replace this with the full hermez-network/zkevm-node setup.
